				<p>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - another important game guideline.</p>

						<h3>Youtubability</h3>
						<p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.</p>
						<p>Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.</p>
						<p>Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :</p>
						<p>For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).</p>
						<p>Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.</p>
